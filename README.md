# TCP-Server

# Explanation

TCP-Client is a project that you can create Server sockets for your programs. It supports basic message sending\recving and file sending\recving.

# Issues

If a client disconnects program goes crazy idk why probably about a while loop.
File sender sometimes works just fine sometimes dont. idk why probably about racing problem.
